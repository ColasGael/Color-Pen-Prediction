# Color-Pen-Prediction
by Gael Colas and Sylvestre Prabakaran, 2nd year students from the French engineering school CentraleSupélec.

 Goal : Realization of an electronic system to reproduce the Color Pen Prediction effect : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2_MQekyIXk
 
 This is a "projet innovation" project we led in our 2nd year in CentraleSupélec (2017). 
 Our supervisors were Hanane Meliani and Laurent Cabaret from the LISA Lab.
 
 This project involved :
  - Arduino : we used an Arduino board to control a force sensor and make weight measurements ;
  - Android : we coded an Android app that receives the measurements via Bluetooth, and provides a user-friendly display to process them ;
  - PCB : we printed a circuit board to compactely gather our electronic components ;
  - 3D-modeling and printing : we modeled and printed a plastic enveloppe to hide our electronic board.

This repository gathers all our code and the files we used in our project. Our final report and presentation is at the root (written in French).
